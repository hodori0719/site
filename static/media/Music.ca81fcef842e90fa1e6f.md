I'm a composer, arranger, and orchestrator. Nowadays I write almost exclusively for orchestra, and my music broadly takes influence from 20th century modal music and the Japanese concert band tradition (吹奏楽/_suisōgaku_).

My orchestral works, most of which are arrangements, have been performed regularly by the [Davenport Pops Orchestra](http://www.dpops.com/performances/?mode=arranger&id=72), which I've led for 3 years, as well the Austin Civic Orchestra, UT Pops Orchestra, and middle/high school orchestras around the country.

My scores, listed below, are available for purchase[^1]; please email me through my address on LinkedIn. The instrumentation uses fairly standard [shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand_for_orchestra_instrumentation); an asterisk denotes that one player is on the standard auxiliary counterpart, while 2d1 might denote that one of two players doubles on auxiliary.

[^1]: I happen to have many of my early (and often subpar) arrangements up on the score—sharing site [musescore.com](https://musescore.com/hodori), a few of which have reached quite a large audience. Several years ago, MuseScore made the unfortunate decision to paywall all it's own community's work. I won't discuss this incident here, but I largely resonate with [Bernard Greenberg's thoughts](https://bernardgreenberg.com/MuseScore.html) on this matter. According to the statistics I have access to, MuseScore has likely earned several hundred dollars from distributing my work. Nonetheless I am committed to keeping them available to the internet; just contact me and I will send them to you free of charge.
