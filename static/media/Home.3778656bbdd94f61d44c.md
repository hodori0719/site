Hi, I'm June! I'm currently at Yale finishing my BS/MS in CS.

Previously, I interned as a software engineer at Spotify, where I did full-stack work on [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com). I'm also interested in graphics, real-time distributed networks for games, and practical applications of probabilistic, randomized, \& approximation algorithms.

Other than that, I love anything to do with the artsâ€”but I'm most often a musician & [orchestrator](/music) ðŸŽ¶.
