This site is a simple markdown renderer in React, using the great `react-markdown` library.

I designed and built the rest of the client from scratch overnight. I'm currently looking for more of my projects and writing to put here, and I plan on posting the source code [here](https://github.com/hodori0719/hodori0719.github.io) once I'm done with it.
